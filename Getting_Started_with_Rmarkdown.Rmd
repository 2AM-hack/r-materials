This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Markdown output for Github rendering
Make sure to also keep the `markdown` files generated by `knitr`, so that the files render properly when hosted on Github (Github doesn't render HTML. Put the following in your YAML header:

```
output:
  html_document:
    keep_md: true
```
